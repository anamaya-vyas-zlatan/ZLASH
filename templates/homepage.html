Being an entrepreneur or a kidpreneur can put you at difficult positions sometimes. You know you have a product (prototype) that could be worth millions but what you lack is resources- money, investors, strategic partners, etc. ZLASH helps you connect to the investors around who are looking for making investments in growing companies, or prototypes or products they see potential in. Sometimes, it happens that you as an entrepreneur have all the resources- manufacturing centers and money to put in your business but don't have a product or any idea that could help people. In this case, you can have a look at the problems posted by people and if you can find a solution to that, you very well have your own company on the way!</p><h2><center><a class="btn btn-dark" href="/register_et" style="background-color: #00022E; color:white; padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px; border-radius:32.5px;">Start Growing</a></center>  </h2>
